# AppleTVParallaxIcons
A FramerJS implementation of the new Apple TV 3D Parallax Icons.

I created it so I could play around with the depth values and get practice using FramerJS.

## Example

## Instructions

1.	Just edit the index.html or any of the example files to point to your own images. 
2.	You'll need to provide a bgLayer.png, a topLayer.png, and a middleLayer.png. I kept it to 3 layers to keep it simple. The dimensions should be 514x828.

## Resources from Apple

Apple provides resources to generate and preview these icons, take a look at ["Creating Parallax Artwork"](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/tvos/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppleTV_PG/CreatingParallaxArtwork.html), however, it requires a Mac and doesn't allow you to play around with the depth values.

The original prototype was made by [Robert van Klinken](https://twitter.com/robertvklinken) and was adapted and modified by [Tareq Ismail](http://www.dribbble.com/tareqismail) to make loading the images easier. The Inbox icon used in one of the examples was provided [by John Mendard](http://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/911-icon-google-inbox-logo-sketch-freebie-resource.html).
