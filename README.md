# AppleTVParallaxIcons
A FramerJS implementation of the new Apple TV 3D Parallax Icons.

I created it so I could play around with the depth values and get practice using FramerJS.

## Example

## Instructions

1.	Just edit the index.html or any of the example files to point to your own images. 
2.	You'll need to provide a bgLayer.png, a topLayer.png, and a middleLayer.png. I kept it to 3 layers to keep it simple. The dimensions should be 514x828.

## From Apple

Apple provides resources to generate and preview these icons, take a look at ["Creating Parallax Artwork"](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/tvos/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppleTV_PG/CreatingParallaxArtwork.html), however, it requires a Mac and doesn't allow you to play around with the depth values.
